# Predict House Prices (Regression)

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on historical data. It uses linear regression and decision trees for predictive analysis.

## Objectives:
- Build a regression model to predict house prices based on features such as size, location, and amenities.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Key Insights
- Achieved an R^2 score of 0.85 on the test dataset.
- Feature importance analysis to identify the most significant factors influencing house prices.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and test the model.
